			<h1>Quantum Mechanics</h1>
			<p>Definition: Quantum mechanics is a fundamental branch of physics that describes the behavior of particles at the atomic and subatomic levels.
			It provides a framework for understanding the wave-particle duality and the probabilistic nature of quantum systems. One of the central equations 
			in quantum mechanics is the Schrödinger equation, which describes the time evolution of a quantum state.
			<br> Mathematical Representation: iħ ∂ψ/∂t = Ĥψ
			<br> Terminologies Present: Common terminologies in quantum mechanics include wave function, superposition, and measurement. 
			The wave function represents the quantum state of a particle and contains information about its position, momentum, and other 
			observable properties. Superposition refers to the ability of quantum systems to exist in multiple states simultaneously. Measurement 
			collapses the wave function, determining the outcome of an observable with a certain probability.<br> 
			Not so fun facts: Quantum mechanics revolutionized our understanding of the microscopic world. It predicts phenomena such as quantum entanglement, 
			where particles can be correlated in ways that classical physics cannot explain. Quantum mechanics is also the foundation of many modern 
			technologies, including lasers, transistors, and quantum computers.</p>

		<div class = "atomphy">
			<h1>Atomic Physics</h1>
			<p>Definition: Atomic physics is the branch of physics that studies the structure and behavior of atoms. 
			Atoms are the basic building blocks of matter and consist of a nucleus, containing protons and neutrons, 
			surrounded by orbiting electrons. One of the key concepts in atomic physics is the quantization of energy levels. Electrons 
			in an atom occupy discrete energy levels, and transitions between these levels give rise to spectral lines. The energy levels of electrons 
			in an atom are described by the Bohr model. 
			<br> Mathematical Representation: E = -13.6 eV / n^2
			<br> Terminologies Present: Common terminologies in atomic physics include atomic spectra, ionization, and electron configurations. 
			Atomic spectra are the unique patterns of light emitted or absorbed by atoms. Ionization refers to the process of removing one or 
			more electrons from an atom, creating a charged ion. Electron configurations describe the distribution of electrons in different 
			atomic orbitals.
			<br> Not so fun facts: Atomic physics has led to the development of various important technologies, such as atomic clocks, lasers, 
			and atomic bombs. The discovery of quantum mechanics and the understanding of atomic structure have provided a deeper understanding 
			of chemical reactions and materials science.</p>

		<div class = "molphy">
			<h1>Molecular Physics</h1>
			<p>Definition: Molecular physics is the branch of physics that focuses on the study of molecules and their properties. It explores 
			the interactions between atoms within a molecule and the forces that hold them together. Understanding molecular physics is 
			crucial for fields such as chemistry, materials science, and biochemistry.
			<br> Mathematical Representation: One of the central equations in molecular physics is the molecular Hamiltonian, which describes the total energy of a molecule.
			<br> Terminologies Present: Common terminologies in molecular physics include molecular orbitals, vibrational modes, and rotational states. 
			Molecular orbitals describe the distribution of electrons within a molecule. Vibrational modes refer to the different ways in which the atoms 
			within a molecule can vibrate, leading to characteristic infrared spectra. Rotational states describe the different possible orientations of a molecule in space.
			<br> Not so fun facts: Molecular physics plays a crucial role in understanding chemical reactions and the behavior of materials. 
			It helps explain phenomena such as molecular bonding, molecular spectroscopy, and the properties of liquids and solids. Molecular 
			physics has practical applications in fields such as pharmaceuticals, materials design, and environmental science.</p>
